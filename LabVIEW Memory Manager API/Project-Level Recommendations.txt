Project-level recommendations

- don't separate projects from code. Directory structure should be:

/<LabVIEW Project>
/<LabVIEW Build Spec>

/Source/<Source Code>
/Source/Tests/<Test Code>

/Examples/<Example Name>/<LabVIEW Project>
/Examples/<Example Name>/Source/<Example Code>

/Development/<VIs>


Moved Project to Root
Moved Build Spec to Root

Removed Build VIs from Library

Resized and positioned fp and bd to conform to API standards
